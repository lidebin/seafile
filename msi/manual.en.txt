Welcome to use Horizonbase client.

Horizonbase client is used to download a "library" from a Horizonbase website, which is
different from other file sync service like dropbox.

1. Create a library on Horizonbase website;

2. Download the library from Horizonbase website;

3. Files added to this donwloaded library will automatically appear on Horizonbase website.

Don't add files to the "Horizonbase" folder. That would not make it appear on the website.
